// statements in javascript are seperated by ';'

console.log("This is a statement");

// it can work without the semicolon in most casses
// javascript will interpreat line break as semicolon if it does not generate any error

console.log("statement without semicolon")

// if interpreting the line break as semicolon does not from an valid statement than javascript will not do that
// Example
console.log(
